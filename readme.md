# CENG 102 Final Project
## Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics

## Introduction:
During World War II, large quantities of toluene were necessary for the production of the
explosive, TNT. After the war, with the reduced need for explosives, alternative uses were sought.
It soon became favorable to convert this toluene to benzene to manufacture various precursors for
nylon.1 The primary technique used initially was the hydrodealkylation of toluene to benzene, or
HDA process. Alternative techniques have been developed since then, including light oil
distillation, catalytic reforming or steam cracking of liquid petroleum, and toluene
disproportionation (TDP). Currently, HDA plants are usually used to maintain the balance of
benzene supplies when all other sources of benzene cannot meet demand.

## Your Assignment:
You will utilize material and energy balances, as learned in CENG 100, and modify them with the
new knowledge you have developed in CENG 102. As before, our goal is to design a system that
(1.) separates the desired and undesired products, (2.) optimizes the recycle structure of the
process, and (3.) maximizes the production of benzene.

## Project Goal:
The purpose of this project is to modify the basic assumptions we made in this plant from CENG
100 and correct our calculations. You will compare how this plant operates under idealized
conditions (ideal reactors, ignoring kinetics, ideal separation units, - all from CENG 100) with
more realistic conditions. This is the first time we are continuing this project since CENG 100,
and it will be expanded upon again in your future classes.

## Process Description:
Toluene and hydrogen are reacted in a high temperature and pressure reactor to produce benzene
and methane. An unavoidable and undesired side-reaction is the further reaction of benzene into
biphneyl (C12H10). If the reactor operating temperature is too low, the benzene can become
hydrogenated and produce cyclohexane. Although this is a common precursor for nylon, it has a
similar boiling point as benzene, yielding an azeotrope and extreme difficulty in separation.
Increased temperature can mitigate this reaction, but lead to hydrocarbon decomposition, known
as coking. The product is subsequently sent through a complex separation train to purify the
benzene product, purge the biphneyl, and recycle unused toluene and hydrogen. The exact
structure of the separation train depends on the desired purity and can vary between one and
three different types of distillation columns.
